######ACME Stuff

###Todo
Everything. This is garbage copy/paste stuff since every tutorial was out of date or didn't do manual DNS. Wanted to do SAN certificatre with letsencrypt for multiple apps, services, and hosts of isolated boxes, so copy/paste of manual dns-01 checks was easiest.

Really need to clean up and refactor into usable scripts, this is just a salvage area so I don't start over from scratch again.

###Do NOT USE this, seriously!
